 * The speaker believes that the US immigration system needs to be reformed to be more inclusive and humane.
            * They support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but also want to address the root causes of immigration, such as the demand for illegal workers.
            * They are concerned about the guest worker program in the bill, which they believe will create a new undocumented immigrant population.
            * They also believe that the point system for future immigrants is flawed and does not reflect the importance of family ties.
            * They propose to remove the arbitrary minimum threshold of points before family ties start to count and to bump up the points for family ties.
            * They also want to sunset the point system in the bill after five years to revisit its intended and unintended consequences.
            * The speaker believes that it is critical that the immigration reform is fully reflective of the powerful tradition of immigration in this country and fully reflective of our values and ideals.
